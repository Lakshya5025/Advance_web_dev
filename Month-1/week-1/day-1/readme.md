## Day 1 — Event Loop & Async Execution

### Concepts

- Call stack and execution contexts
- Heap and memory references
- Microtask queue vs macrotask queue
- Event loop cycles and scheduling
- Why some tasks jump the queue

### Hands-On Practice

- Write 25 short async prediction examples (no code, just logic)
- Create 10 microtask vs macrotask conflict scenarios
- Predict results **before** evaluating them
- Document why each line runs in that order
- Create a list of rules summarizing event loop behavior
- Identify mistakes developers frequently make with async
- Journaling exercise: Write how you would explain the event loop to a junior
