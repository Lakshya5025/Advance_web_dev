## Day 3 — Prototype System, “this”, and Object Behavior

### Concepts

- Prototype chain traversal
- Property lookup rules
- “this” binding rules
- How method inheritance actually works in JS
- Difference between instance vs prototype methods
- Shadowing and method overriding

### Hands-On Practice

- Draw prototype chains for 5 custom object setups
- Describe step-by-step how JS finds a method on an object
- Write 10 “this binding” scenarios and analyze the value of “this”
- Compare function call styles and how they change behavior
- Write a conceptual model of how JS simulates “classes”
