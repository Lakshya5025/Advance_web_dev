## Day 2 — Closures, Scope & Memory

### Concepts

- Closure lifetime
- Lexical environment model
- Reference retention
- Common closure pitfalls
- Garbage collection behavior
- How variables remain alive even after the parent scope
- Why closures cause accidental memory leaks

### Hands-On Practice

- Create 10 real closure examples (described conceptually)
- Explain what each closure retains and why
- Create a conceptual memory leak example using closure retention
- Explain how GC handles (or fails to handle) these situations
- Create 5 scope-related confusion scenarios
- Describe how you would fix each memory issue conceptually
- Document closure vs block scope behaviors
